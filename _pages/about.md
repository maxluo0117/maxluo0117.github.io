Nice to meet you! This is Linyan Luo, PhD candidate in the [Urban Spatial Science Research Lab](https://www.risk.tsukuba.ac.jp/~ussrl/public_html/en_index.htm), [Doctoral program in risk and resilience engineering at the University of Tsukuba](https://www.risk.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/). 
Before joining the University of Tsukuba, I received my bachelor’s degree from the school of geographical sciences in Southwest University, Chongqing, China.

My research interests mainly lie in:
- Spatial data analysis 
- Sustainable transport policy (especially in complex terrain)
- Facility location problems
- GeoAI

For more details regarding my research, please refer to my *Publication* and *Talk* page.

In addition, I have a strong interest in *ArcPy*, *Machine learning and deep learning models related to geospatial weighting*, *3D data processing*, and *WebGIS*. I regularly share my personal learning notes and practical experiences related to these topics at the link below.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me via email at *s2420561@u.tsukuba.ac.jp*, or *MaxineLuo0117@outlook.com*.
