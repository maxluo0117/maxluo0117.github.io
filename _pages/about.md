Nice to meet you! This is Linyan Luo, PhD candidate in the [Urban Spatial Science Research Lab](https://www.risk.tsukuba.ac.jp/~ussrl/public_html/en_index.htm), [Doctoral program in risk and resilience engineering at the University of Tsukuba](https://www.risk.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/). My research focuses on urban spatial analysis, spatially explicit modeling, and the interactions between the built environment, transportation systems, and urban risk and resilience.

I received bachelor of Science degree in school of geographical sciences from Southwest University, China. Subsequently, I completed a master’s program in Risk and Resilience Engineering from University of Tsukuba, Japan, where I developed a strong interest in spatial data analysis and the application of quantitative methods to urban and transportation-related problems.
