Nice to meet you! This is Linyan Luo(罗 淋琰， ラ　リンエン), PhD candidate in the [Urban Spatial Science Research Lab](https://www.risk.tsukuba.ac.jp/~ussrl/public_html/en_index.htm), [Doctoral program in risk and resilience engineering at the University of Tsukuba](https://www.risk.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/). 
Before joining the University of Tsukuba, I received my bachelor’s degree from [the school of geographical sciences in Southwest University](https://geography.swu.edu.cn/), Chongqing, China.

My research interests mainly lie in:
- Spatial data analysis 
- Sustainable transport policy (especially in complex terrain)
- Facility location problems
- GeoAI

For more details regarding my research, please refer to my [Publications](https://maxluo0117.github.io/publications/) and [Talks](https://maxluo0117.github.io/talks/) page.

In addition, I have a strong interest in [ArcPy](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.4/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm), Machine learning and deep learning models related to geospatial weighting, 3D data processing, and [WebGIS](https://www.webgis.com/). I regularly share my personal learning notes and practical experiences related to these topics at the link below：
